# Shoppinglist

A small shopping list app. Mostly an attempt to explore how close to a native app you can get using just html5 and javascript with no backend at all (other than a webserver serving static files that is)

# Planned additions

- Autocomplete of previously seen items
- Synch across devices using the users dropbox
